# A Thought About Crawlers

Today's class we learned crawler by using tagui.

```
import tagui as t
t.init()
t.url('...')
t.type('Singapore Weather','[enter]')
```

Very easy to use, it can press enter but js can't do it. But, is it really a easist crawler? No, because xpath is difficult to detect, I decied to develop a extension to easy find xpath, and auto convert crawler step to code.

Let us wait and see.
